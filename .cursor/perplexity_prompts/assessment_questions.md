## Prompt

I need detailed assessment questions for evaluating manufacturing operations in a high-mix low-volume (HMLV) environment. Please provide questions for the following categories:

1. Plant Layout & Process Flow
2. Lean Manufacturing Implementation
3. Planning & Scheduling Systems
4. Production Efficiency
5. Changeover Effectiveness
6. Maintenance Programs
7. Quality Management
8. Warehouse & Logistics
9. Automation & Technology
10. Plant Management & Leadership

For each category, provide:
- 5-7 questions that evaluate maturity level
- Each question should be answerable on a 1-5 scale
- Include evaluation guidance/criteria for each question
- Focus on HMLV-specific challenges
- Include industry best practices in the criteria

Format each question as:
```sql
('category_name', 'Question text?', 'Evaluation guidance including specific criteria to consider', importance_weight)
```

Where:
- category_name: matches the categories above (snake_case)
- Question text: starts with "How", "What", or similar
- Evaluation guidance: includes specific points to consider
- importance_weight: 2 for standard questions, 3 for critical aspects

Example:
```sql
('lean_manufacturing', 'How effective is your visual management system for high-mix production?', 'Consider setup instructions, quality standards, production status boards, and work instructions. Evaluate clarity, accessibility, and regular updates.', 2)
```

Focus on:
1. Specific challenges of HMLV environments
2. Industry 4.0 and digital transformation
3. Modern manufacturing best practices
4. Lean principles adapted for high-mix production
5. Quality systems for complex operations
6. Workforce development and knowledge management

Include questions that address:
- Process flexibility and adaptability
- Setup time reduction and changeover optimization
- Quality control in variable production
- Inventory management for diverse parts
- Technology integration and automation
- Workforce skills and training
- Data collection and analysis
- Continuous improvement culture

Please provide comprehensive, industry-standard questions that would help manufacturers assess their operational maturity and identify improvement opportunities.
